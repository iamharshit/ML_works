# Binary Subtractor
A Recurrent Neural Network is trained to predict difference of 2 numbers.

### Why RNN?
In this project RNN is used other then any other Neural Network to capture the carry over aspect in substraction i.e prediction of new digit from the also requires a memory aspect of the previous digits which is only captured in RNN.
