## What is it?
Basically extracting human emotions/sentiments from his/her Language.

## Ways: 
There are 2 main approches to sentiment analysis-
1.Lexicon Based Approach: Bag of words is constructed from the input text.Each word in the bag is converted to number representing the subjectivity of that word which is then summed to get the overall subjectivity which represents the sentiment level of the text.

2.Machine Learning Approach: Learn the Sentiment for each sentence form the training data.

Build vectors for each

## Comparison

Using Lexicon based approach we would fail to wrong result for scarcastic sentences.

Detecting sarcasm is possible with Deep net if our training data do contain sarcasm.
