A simple implementation of Q-Learning where given a initial state(here 'room no. in a house') the model learns to predict the best path to the goal state(here 'outside the house').

Although the problem would have been solved using Dikstra's Algorithm within less time & less computational power, this is just to implemented just to see the power of Q-Learning.
