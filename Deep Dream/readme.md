## Dataset 

We are using Google's already trained model.It was trained on labeled set of images where the first layers learned low-level features eg.edges, shapes but the last layers contains mixture of features.We inputted the image and asked the computer to modify the similarity between our image and image at particular layer.We use gradient descent to tune the parameters of our input image to represent image by NNet's layer.
